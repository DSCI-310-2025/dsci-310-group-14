# Summary
The COVID-19 pandemic led to significant public health measures, such as lockdowns and vaccinations, which have increased stress and anxiety worldwide. This study aims to explore how factors like hospitalizations and new vaccinations correlate with anxiety-related Google searches in the United States (US) during the pandemic.

# Introduction
In response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, public health measures such as lockdowns, social distancing, and vaccination drives have significantly impacted daily lives. These unprecedented measures, while essential for managing the health crisis, have led to increased levels of stress and anxiety among populations worldwide [@Murphy2021]. Several studies have highlighted the psychological impacts of the pandemic, noting increased incidences of anxiety and other mental health disorders as people cope with isolation, uncertainty, and changes to their normal routines [@Prati2021]. Furthermore, the rapid dissemination of information and sometimes misinformation through media channels has played a crucial role in shaping public perceptions and reactions to the pandemic [@Neill2023]. This phenomenon, often referred to as the "infodemic," has contributed to heightened anxiety levels, driving more people to seek information online about COVID-19 and its implications for their health and safety [@BorgesdoNascimento2022].

This study aims to analyze how certain factors such as hospitalizations, vaccinations, and confirmed cases correlate with the trends in Google searches for anxiety in the United States. More specifically, we want to find out the following: **How do COVID-19 vaccination rates, hospitalization rates, and confirmed cases relate to anxiety-related search patterns during the pandemic?**

# Methods:
## Data
To find an answer to this question, we performed an analysis on a dataset of US daily COVID-19 data and Google search trends from January 2020 until now. The raw data set contains 991 rows Ã— 564 columns, within which includs 6 variables relavant to our question. Our variables of interest are as following:

- `date`: date of data collection in YYYY/MM/DD format
- `search_trends_anxiety`: the prevalence of anxiety in google searches
- `new_persons_vaccinated`: count of new persons who have received one or more doses
- `new_hospitalized_patients`: count of new cases hospitalized after a positive test
- `new_confirmed`: count of new cases confirmed after a positive test
- `new_intensive_care_patients`: count of new COVID-19 positive cases admitted to ICU

By studying these variables, we are attempting to observe patterns and correlations that can reveal the mental health response of the public to the pandemic.

#| code-fold: true
# load libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(GGally)
library(purrr)
library(knitr)

```

```{r}
#| echo: false
us_covid <- read_csv("../data/raw/US.csv")
```

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
During EDA, we will first select only the 6 variables of interest for further exploratory data analysis and regression analysis. This preliminary variable selection is then followed by computation of their summary statistic and visualizations to explore the trends and patterns among the relevant variables:

```{r}
#| label: tbl-selected-data
#| tbl-cap: "Preview of US COVID-19 search trend dataset with selected variables of interest."
us_selected <- us_covid |> 
              select(date, search_trends_anxiety, new_persons_vaccinated, new_hospitalized_patients, new_confirmed, new_intensive_care_patients) |> 
              drop_na()
knitr::kable(head(us_selected))
```

```{r}
# summarise all numeric values with 5 number summary + mean
covid_summary <- us_selected %>%
  summarise(across(where(is.numeric), list(
    Min = min,
    Q25 = ~quantile(.x, 0.25),
    Mean = mean,
    Median = median,
    Q75 = ~quantile(.x, 0.75),
    Max = max
  ), .names = "{.col}_{.fn}")) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = everything(), names_to = c("Variable", "Statistic"), names_sep = "_(?=[^_]+$)") %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = Statistic, values_from = value)
```
The following @tbl-summary displays summary statistics of all 6 variables of interest relavant to our research question. Notably, we see that `new_persons_vaccinated` and `new_intensive_care_patients` contain many missing values which would be removed from the data before they enter into further analysis.

Moreover, we see that on average, there are around 80,0000 people getting newly vaccinated across the entirety of the COVID-19 pandemic in the US.
```{r}
#| label: tbl-summary
#| tbl-cap: "Summary statistics of selected variables with missing values counts of the original dataset."


dates_day <- as.numeric(us_selected$date)

date_summary <- tibble(Variable = c("date"),
                      Min = min(dates_day),
                      Q25 = quantile(dates_day, 0.25),
                      Mean = mean(dates_day),
                      Median = median(dates_day),
                      Q75 = quantile(dates_day, 0.75),
                      Max = max(dates_day))|>
                mutate(across(where(is.numeric), as_date))

table_summary <- rbind(covid_summary,date_summary)

#Count missing values from original dataset
us_missing <- us_covid |>
  select(search_trends_anxiety, new_persons_vaccinated, new_hospitalized_patients,
         new_confirmed, new_intensive_care_patients,date)

us_missing_counts <- tibble(Variable = table_summary$Variable,
                            Observations = colSums(!is.na(us_missing)),
                            Missing = colSums(is.na(us_missing)))

#combine together all summary data
table_summary_final <- inner_join(table_summary, us_missing_counts, by = "Variable")
knitr::kable(table_summary_final)
```

From the @fig-pairplot pairplot visualization above, we see that new vaccination status and time progression (`date`) has positive moderate association with anxiety search trend. Meanwhile, new hospitalization patient rate is negatively and moderately correlated with anxiety search trend. 

The remaining variables such as the number of newly confirmed COVID-19 cases (`new_confirmed`) and newly admitted intensive care patints (`new_intensive_care_patients`) either show weak negative correlation or no correlation with anxiety search trend.

In @fig-trend, we can observe that anxiety searches seem to be consistent across the COVID-19 pandemic except for 3 peaks around winter of 2020, spring of 2021, and spring of 2022.


## Feature Selection: Backward Selection
In this section, we perform feature selection using backward seleciton method. Using backward selection, we will be able to select the number of variables has optimal predictive ability using measures of adjusted $R^2$. Higher adjusted $R^2$ indicates better predictive performance of the features.

```{r}
set.seed(310)

# split data into training and testing sets:
bwd_select_train <- sample_n(us_selected, size = nrow(us_selected) * 0.3,
                        replace = FALSE)
model_data <- anti_join(us_selected, 
                        bwd_select_train,
                        by = "date")
covid_train <- sample_n(model_data, size = nrow(model_data) * 0.7,
                        replace = FALSE)
covid_test <- anti_join(model_data, 
                        covid_train,
                        by = "date")
```
Using backward selection over the 5 feature variables, @Tbl-bwd-selection gives the selection results, showing which feature is being selected into the model each time (the selected variable is denoted as `TRUE`). @Tbl-bwd-performance shows the adjusted $R^2$ (`ADJ.R2`) performance of model corresponding to the number of `TRUE` feature input(s) displayed in @tbl-bwd-selection.
```{r}
#| label: tbl-bwd-selection
#| tbl-cap: "The features being selected during each step of backward model selection."
# converts dates into number of days:
covid_train_numeric <- covid_train |> 
                       mutate(date = as.numeric(date))


# backward selection:
covid_backward_sel <- regsubsets(x = search_trends_anxiety ~ new_persons_vaccinated + 
                                                             new_hospitalized_patients +
                                                             new_confirmed +
                                                             new_intensive_care_patients +
                                                             date,
                                  nvmax = 5,
                                  data = covid_train_numeric,
                                  method = "backward",)

covid_bwd_summary <- summary(covid_backward_sel)

knitr::kable(covid_bwd_summary$which)

```

```{r}
#| label: tbl-bwd-performance
#| tbl-cap: "RSQ, RSS, and Adjusted R^2 of each model with the number of features used."
covid_bwd_performance <- tibble(n_input_variables = 1:5, 
                                RSQ = covid_bwd_summary$rsq, 
                                ADJ.R2 = covid_bwd_summary$adjr2)
knitr::kable(covid_bwd_performance)

highest_ADJ.R2 <- round(pull(slice_max(covid_bwd_performance, ADJ.R2), ADJ.R2), 3)
chosen_n_input <- covid_bwd_performance |>
                  slice_max(ADJ.R2) |>
                  pull(n_input_variables)
```
> To select the best-performing features to use to predict Anxiety google searches during the COVID-19 pandemic, we used backward selection to pick the set of features that would produce the best highest adjusted $R^2$ value. Higher $R^2$ value greater predicative ability of the feature variables for the response variable, thereby giving us the model that explained our data the best.
>
> As seen in @tbl-bwd-performance, a model with 3 features (`n_input_variables` = `{r} chosen_n_input` due to intercept being counted as an input variable by the selection algorithm) provides the highest adjusted $R^2$ value at `{r} highest_ADJ.R2` based on the validation set. This model contains the variables `new_persons_vaccinated`, `new_hospitalized_patients`, and `date`, which provides some evidence for our hypothesis that higher vaccination rates and greater hospitalization may lead to greater anxiety search trend during COVID-19.

## Creating the final model using selected variables

```{r}
#| label: tbl-coefficients
#| tbl-cap: "Coefficients and intercept of the selected linear model."
final_model <- lm(search_trends_anxiety ~ new_persons_vaccinated + new_hospitalized_patients + date, data = covid_train_numeric)
final_model_df <- tidy(final_model)
knitr::kable(final_model_df)
new_vax_coef <- signif(final_model_df$estimate[2], digit = 3)
new_hos_coef <- signif(final_model_df$estimate[3], digit = 3)
date_coef    <- signif(final_model_df$estimate[4], digit = 3)
intercept_coef <- round(final_model_df$estimate[1], 3)


```

According to the resultant coefficients from @tbl-coefficients, we create a linear formula of our regression model:

*Anxiety search trend = $`{r} new_vax_coef`$ New Vaccination $`{r} new_hos_coef`$ New Hospitalization $`{r} date_coef`$ Date + $`{r} intercept_coef`$*

> (*note: `Date` is measured in number of days*)

## Model Evaluation

```{r}
#| label: tbl-metrics
#| tbl-cap: "Model performance metrics."
# make sure dates are in numeric form as days since 1970-01-01
covid_test_numeric <- covid_test|> 
                      mutate(date = as.numeric(date))
# apply the model to predict test data
final_model_predictions <- predict(final_model, newdata = covid_test_numeric)

# find the RMSE between the model's prediction and the actual values
final_model_RMSPE = rmse(preds = final_model_predictions,
                        actuals = covid_test_numeric$search_trends_anxiety)

# R-squared:
r_sqr <- summary(final_model)$r.squared

# create dataframe with RMSPE and R-squared
metrics_results<-tibble(RMSPE = final_model_RMSPE, R_square = r_sqr)

knitr::kable(metrics_results)

```

The current model has a root mean square prediction error (RMSPE) of `{r} round(final_model_RMSPE, 3)`, suggesting a large discrepancy between the actual response variable and the predicted response variable anxiety search. 

At the same time, this model has a $R^2$ of `{r} round(r_sqr, 3)`, suggesting that around `{r} round(r_sqr, 2) * 100`% of variance in anxiety Google search trend during the COVID-19 pandemic is explained conjointly by new vaccination, new hospitalization, and progression of time.


# Discussion
## Summary of Findings

Our results discovered that COVID-19 pandemic-anxiety-related search patterns were weakly influenced by the vaccination rate, hospital rates, and the time elapsed. The vaccination rate increase was strongly correlated with anxiety-related search increases, but growing hospital rates were correlated with decreased anxiety searches. The model's `{r} round(r_sqr, 2) * 100`% variance explanation suggests the possibility that additional independent variables beyond what was measured within the database may also contribute to a massive amount of this variance.

## Expected vs. Actual Results

The small but positive relationship between vaccination rates and anxiety searches went against our expectations as one would expect higher vaccination rates would reduce anxiety. However, it could be an expression of public concern regarding side effects of vaccinations or the overall impact of vaccination campaigns on society. The negative relationship between hospitalization rates and anxiety searches aligns with the hypothesis that serious COVID-19 complications will generate fewer online searches because of increased stress or disengagement.

## Impact of Findings

These are indicators of the complex interactions between public and mental health interventions during a pandemic. Knowledge of these interactions could allow policymakers to develop improved communication strategies for reducing worry and anxiety in the public.

## Future Questions

- Future research areas might include:
- The role of media coverage in producing anxiety-supportive search trends.
- The impact of other measures of mental health, depression or stress, on searching.
